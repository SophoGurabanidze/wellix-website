    "Wellix was founded in 2021 to contribute, together with its German partners, to the development of premium-quality well construction in Georgia. This primarily means establishing a new standard for well drilling and setup in the country—one that enables optimal, environmentally safe use of Georgia's underground water resources.",
    "However, the activity of our team and its leading experts began much earlier. In 2002, the Gurabanidze brothers founded the company Imedi, continuing a family tradition in this field. As a result, some of our key specialists now have over 30 years of professional experience.",
    "Together with its Georgian and international partners, Imedi has successfully implemented numerous projects aimed at improving Georgia’s water supply system. Since its founding, our team has completed around 150 successful projects and built over 200 fully operational wells across the country.",
    "We are especially proud of organizing the construction of drinking water wells and supply systems in 44 conflict-affected villages throughout Georgia.",
    "Today, Wellix is one of the leading companies in Georgia. Together with its German partners, it has implemented premium well construction projects for major clients such as Coca-Cola Bottlers Georgia – Mtis Water, Nabeghlavi – Tskali Margebeli, Redix – Kvareli Baga, and others."

    "title": "Hydrogeological Report – The Importance of Proper Well Design",
    "content": "The hydrogeological report is the first stage of a well project. It is prepared by a hydrogeologist based on existing reference materials (location, climate, geomorphology, hydrogeological maps, geological cross-sections, and data from nearby wells) and fieldwork conducted on-site (geophysical survey). Therefore, potential clients must first obtain a hydrogeological report, as it determines whether to proceed with or terminate the project."
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "title": "The Importance of the Hydrogeological Report for Potential Clients",
    "content": "Drilling a well without a hydrogeological report is neither purposeful nor financially justified. The report is essential for potential clients to evaluate the approximate budget for construction and what they will receive in return for the investment. Sometimes, a negative conclusion is issued, which is still a valuable outcome—saving the client from unnecessary expenses. In such cases, the report recommends alternative water supply methods, such as using natural springs or surface water sources."
  },
  {
    "id": "3",
    "title": "The Importance of the Hydrogeological Report for Well Constructors",
    "content": "Based on the hydrogeological report, the constructor learns the key parameters of the well:\n• Geological conditions (lithology of rock layers)\n• Well depth and construction (drilling and casing pipe/filter diameters)\n• Type of installation materials\n• Expected water yield\n• Static and dynamic water levels\n• Chemical composition, mineralization, etc.\n\nThis information enables the constructor to prepare the cost estimate for well construction and installation."

    "id": "4",
    "title": "Preparing a Commercial Offer for a Potential Client",
    "content": "For us, as a well constructor, it is critical to first receive the well construction drawing and geological data (rock lithology). Based on this, we can prepare one or more tailored commercial offers for the client. When preparing the offer, we separate the cost of labor from the cost of installation materials, allowing the client to more easily select technically and financially appropriate materials."
  },
  {
    "id": "5",
    "title": "Well Construction Cost",
    "content": "The cost of a well depends on the following factors:\n• The client’s technical assignment\n• Location and depth of drilling\n• Construction design and type/quality of materials\n• Geological conditions (rock lithology)\n• Volume of required test work\n• Intended purpose of water use\n\nCost estimation is the final stage of the design process, after the hydrogeological conditions, depth, and construction of the well are determined."
  },
  {
    "id": "6",
    "title": "Well Service Life",
    "content": "The operational lifespan of a well depends on:\n\n• The chemical and gas composition of the water\n• Its corrosiveness toward metal and concrete\n• The proper selection of casing and structural materials\n• The client's adherence to operational recommendations stated in the well passport"
  },
  {
    "id": "7",
    "title": "Impact of Installation Material Quality on Final Well Cost",
    "content": "Necessary installation materials include: casing pipes, filters, centralizers, piezometers, appropriately selected gravel, pump, control system, etc. Quality differences in these materials can significantly affect the total cost. Choosing low-cost, short-lifespan materials may result in poor water quality, reduced operational efficiency, and shorter service life. Poor materials inevitably lead to future additional costs, making an initially low price much more expensive in the long run."
  },
  {
    "id": "8",
    "title": "Well Passport",
    "content": "After drilling, a well passport is issued that includes all technical data related to the well:\n• Location;\n• Drilling rig type and model;\n• Well structure (drilling, casing/filter diameters and intervals, pump model, capacity, and installation depth);\n• Aquifer characteristics (static and dynamic levels, yield, filtration coefficient, transmissivity, and radius of influence);\n• Recommendations (general and specific) for optimal operation.\n\nThe well passport is essential for proper operation and future rehabilitation, if needed."
  },
  {
    "id": "9",
    "title": "Importance of the Well Passport for Owners",
    "content": "A well passport is vital for proper operation and future rehabilitation.\nOver time, sand may accumulate in the well, partially or fully clogging the filters.\nPreventive maintenance must be conducted regularly, which is not possible without the passport.\n\nEach well we construct is designed to serve its owner for decades if used properly.\nPersonnel may change or forget the original data, so having the passport is in the user's best interest."
  },
  {
    "id": "10",
    "title": "Well Warranty Period – What It Should Include",
    "content": "The warranty period is defined by agreement between the two parties. It covers the repair or replacement of any defect identified during the warranty period, and rectification of any damages caused by substandard work. However, it does not cover natural occurrences—such as well silting—which are not the result of poor workmanship but require proper maintenance by the well owner."
  },
  {
    "id": "11",
    "title": "Closure/Conservation of Old or Abandoned Wells",
    "content": "An unused well must be properly closed or conserved. If it discharges water naturally, it pollutes the environment. If the water level is negative, debris may fall in and contaminate the aquifer. For each case, a hydrogeologist must develop a conservation plan that eliminates any future environmental risks."
